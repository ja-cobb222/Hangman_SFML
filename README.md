# Overview

This project is a graphical version of the classic Hangman game developed in C++ using the SFML library. The purpose of this project was to further enhance my knowledge of game development and graphical user interface design while also deepening my understanding of C++ programming concepts, including object-oriented design and file handling.

The Hangman game includes features such as random word selection from an external file, drawing the hangman piece by piece as the player makes incorrect guesses, and user input validation. The game also handles win/loss conditions with proper feedback, and it reveals the correct word upon losing.

My goal in developing this software was to strengthen my C++ programming skills while learning how to integrate a graphical user interface using external libraries like SFML.
